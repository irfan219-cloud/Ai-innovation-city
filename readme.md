## 🚨 The Problem

India generates **62 million tons** of municipal waste annually. Only **43% gets processed scientifically** - meaning **35+ million tons** is illegally dumped or poorly managed.

**The Real Issue**: Not technology - it's **coordination**.
- Citizens can't report problems effectively
- Workers get random assignments 
- No predictive intelligence
- Zero community engagement incentives
